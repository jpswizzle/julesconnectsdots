## Synopsis

###

### A brief tour of the product space

Granicus enables over 5,500 North American public-sector organizations to efficiently serve and connect to their resident base.

Its broad product portfolio (prior to a private equity acquisition in late 2016) spanned legacy agenda management; boards and commissions management; and a suite of tools for recording, livestreaming, and documenting public meetings. Its customer base includes the United States House and Senate.

**Peak Agenda Management joined Granicus' portfolio as a SaaS single-page application for government staff in small towns.**

* Our objective was to ship a user-friendly platform that streamlined agenda workflows for municipalities with populations of less than 100,000.
* This would eliminate the need for small customers to buy, implement, and use our flagship agenda management solution, which was too complex for most small government workflows.
* The Peak tech stack included Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, and ReactJS.

#### Value proposition

Peak Agenda Management aimed to tap into sales whitespace, increase competitive advantage, and drastically reduce the time spent building and publishing public meeting agendas (ex: City Council, Planning Committee, etc.).

From a product strategy standpoint, **Peak was purpose-built** to provide small municipalities with the following benefits:

* **Minimal training time:** Make it easy for government users to learn how to coordinate agendas and contribute agenda items.
* **Collaborative workflows:** Empower everyone who contributes to a public meeting agenda to collaborate on agenda items, from draft to final version.
* **Easy setup and administration:** Enable customer admins to quickly configure Peak and get their team up and running in less than a day.
* **No upfront professional services costs:** Eliminate the need for solution engineering and upfront professional services engagement.

### The Team

As Manager of User Experience, I led my small-but-mighty team in a player-coach role. The UX team comprised a junior UI designer, a UX Strategist, and a Lead UX Researcher.

In addition to people management, I was responsible for research, end-to-end product design, and content development.

During my 2 years at Granicus, I…

* **Drove cross-functional alignment on UX outcomes** by partnering with a Senior Product Manager, Engineering Lead, QA Engineer, and full-stack engineers
* **Socialized UX value and process** with trainings and presentations, including a presentation during the January Sales Kickoff (SKO)
* **Hired the Lead UX Researcher** (backfill), who was later promoted to Product Manager

### Approach

Leveraging foundational user discovery and an early-stage design system, I ran a 2-week design sprint cadence integrated with the agile SDLC. Working side-by-side with my team, I led discovery, design, and usability testing.

* In every sprint we conducted research, ideated, iterated, and aligned with Product and Engineering via product consultations and feasibility reviews.
* I owned and guided UX research (including contextual inquiry), socialized findings,&nbsp; and made recommendations.
* I collaborated closely with my UX Strategist, Matt B. to translate complex requirements into concepts, wireframes, prototypes, and high-fi designs.

Our design sprint process and strong cross-functional partnerships **enabled us to regularly deliver high-quality designs in pace with Engineering's 2-week sprint cadence**.

We launched Peak in September 2015, **in the span of 7 months**.

### Key results

> Peak is much more user-friendly than our old system. – Daralyn S., Municipal Clerk

> Our cost savings and our time savings and efficiency is definitely measurable.<br>– Shane P., Borough Manager

Peak's intuitive Admin console—designed entirely by my team and me—enabled quick and easy self-service setup for both admins and other users.

* **Drastically reduced training time:** With Peak, we reduced training required *from days to hours* compared to the legacy product.
* **Intuitive onboarding:** A town clerk in Nevada was able to set up the Admin console *in just 2 hours without any training*.
* **Reduced operational overhead for Granicus:**&nbsp; The self-service onboarding freed up bandwidth for Professional Services to focus on complex engagements with larger customers.

### Achievements

* **DesignOps:** I extended our UX runway from less than 2 weeks to over 2 months via cross-functional partnership, UX backlog management, and design sprints.
* **Design durability:** The popover menu I designed is still in use today, as evidenced by [this Granicus knowledge base article](https://support.granicus.com/s/article/Generating-Agenda-Item-Packets-in-Peak?language=en_US&amp;c=govMeetings%20Suite&amp;p=Peak){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}.
