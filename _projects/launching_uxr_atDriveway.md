title: Launching UX Research at Driveway
subtitle: How I launched a comprehensive research program at Driveway (NYSE:LAD)

  When I joined Driveway shortly after they launched, they had no UX researcher
  but a strong appetite for learning. The UXR program I launched steered product
  and design decisions across the entire funnel as well as internal tools.

## Redefining the car ownership lifecycle

Driveway aims to support the full car ownership lifecycle, from buying and financing to servicing and selling your vehicle— all from the convenience of your browser and your own Driveway.

### The automotive terrain

* Competes with Carvana, CarMax, and Cars.com
* Innovation hub: startup owned and operated by Lithia Motors (NYSE: LAD)
  * largest new-car retailer in the U.S.$28.2B in revenue in 2022
  * Currently \#145 on the Fortune 500
* Initial launch in Q4 2020 (expedited by the pandemic)
* 8 “journey teams” = PDE squads

This program encompassed intake and roadmapping for multi-method research, standards for execution, and best practices for cross-functional collaboration.

### Joining Driveway

I started at Driveway in January 2021, just a few months after their initial launch.

* Led Product Design for account center, homepage, internal tools, inventory
* Acted as the XD program manager, launching programs for Design System, UX Research, and orchestrating Driveway's "2.woah" brand refresh

## A clear need for research

It was obvious that Driveway needed to press the gas on research. I collaborated with my manager, the Director of Experience Design, to define the need:

> Our features sometimes don't perform as we expect, and **we don't understand why.**
>
> This **poses a risk to our investment** in what we bring to market.
>
> Currently, we gather data and insights about Driveway customers' goals and expectations via **ad hoc research studies**, with immediate needs addressed on a first-come, first-served basis.

### Speedbumps on the racetrack

Driveway posed the following challenges to launching a research program

* No UX Researcher
* High on assumptions, low on UX maturity
* Shoehorned research tool
* Rapid delivery cycle & emerging processes
* Skepticism from the XD Director (my boss)

### My objective

Formally launch UX Research as a product development function. Steer Product and Design decisions through learning, data, and insights.

## Approach: Program Pillars

### Implementing the program

*\[this could be a carousel?\]*

1. Staff research
2. Set the course for research maturity
3. Pilot research partnership and process
4. Enable the right kind of learning
5. Make research plans visible
6. Make **How** as important as **Why**
7. Make learning actionable

## Program impact

*\[this could be a carousel?\]*

1. Successful liftoff
2. Tool enablement
3. Durable process + scalable impact
4. Effectiveness of Lean hypothesis
5. Cohesive team learning

## Reflection

### What went well

#### Research execution and overall partnership

1. **Cross-functional involvement in end-to-end research:**&nbsp;Research directly influenced Product and Design decisions that positively impacted Driveway OKRs as reported in product analytics.
2. **Achieved and maintained a good momentum.**
3. **Laid the foundation for continued research planning and prioritization.** Based on the process I established for inputs to research roadmapping, Amy continued to use participatory formats to evaluate partners’ research needs and prioritize research efforts.

I've summarized the first 3 months of the UXR program in a table

### What didn’t go so well

#### Early collaboration bumps & temporary tool gap

1. There were some collaboration bumps early on between cross-functional teammates
2. There was a ~2-month research tool gap while Lithia finalized the dscout contract—but we had a backup plan involving a pay-as-you-go tool.
3. I was wearing 3 hats and had a lot of work in progress (WIP), which made it challenging to get any one program initiative done quickly.
