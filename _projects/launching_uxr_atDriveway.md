title: Launching UX Research at Driveway
subtitle: How I launched a comprehensive research program at Driveway (NYSE:LAD)

  When I joined Driveway shortly after they launched, they had no UX researcher
  but a strong appetite for learning. The UXR program I launched steered product
  and design decisions across the entire funnel as well as internal tools.

## Redefining the car ownership lifecycle

Driveway aims to support the full car ownership lifecycle, from buying and financing to servicing and selling your vehicle— all from the convenience of your browser and your own Driveway.

### The automotive terrain

* Competes with Carvana, CarMax, and Cars.com
* Innovation hub: startup owned and operated by Lithia Motors (NYSE: LAD)
  * largest new-car retailer in the U.S.$28.2B in revenue in 2022
  * Currently \#145 on the Fortune 500
* Initial launch in Q4 2020 (expedited by the pandemic)
* 8 “journey teams” = PDE squads

This program encompassed intake and roadmapping for multi-method research, standards for execution, and best practices for cross-functional collaboration.

### Joining Driveway

I started at Driveway in January 2021, just a few months after their initial launch.

* Led Product Design for account center, homepage, internal tools, inventory
* Acted as the XD program manager, launching programs for Design System, UX Research, and orchestrating Driveway's "2.woah" brand refresh

## A clear need for research

It was obvious that Driveway needed to press the gas on research. I collaborated with my manager, the Director of Experience Design, to define the need:

> Our features sometimes don't perform as we expect, and **we don't understand why.**
>
> This **poses a risk to our investment** in what we bring to market.
>
> Currently, we gather data and insights about Driveway customers' goals and expectations via **ad hoc research studies**, with immediate needs addressed on a first-come, first-served basis.

### Speedbumps on the racetrack

Driveway posed the following challenges to launching a research program

* No UX Researcher
* High on assumptions, low on UX maturity
* Shoehorned research tool
* Rapid delivery cycle & emerging processes
* Skepticism from the XD Director (my boss)

### My objective

Formally launch UX Research as a product development function. Steer Product and Design decisions through learning, data, and insights.

## Approach: Program Pillars

My approach to launching a UX Research program encompassed 4 program pillars:

1. Staff UX Research
2. Identify Design and Product’s learning needs
3. Procure the right research tool for meeting those needs
4. Create a cross-cutting research roadmap

### Implementing the program

1. Hired the first dedicated UX Researcher&nbsp;
2. Set the course for research maturity
3. Piloted research partnership and process
4. Enabled the right kind of learning by procuring dscout
5. Make research plans visible
6. Make **How** as important as **Why**
7. Make learning actionable

## Program impact

> The findings from the co-shopping study helped inform feature prioritization and de-prioritization for Account and Shop. – Amy C.

1. **Successful program liftoff**
   1. Supported 4 journey teams across the funnel in the first 2 months
   2. Achieved initial research velocity of 7 studies per quarter
2. **Tool enablement**
   1. Identified that Driveway teams’ learning needs were in the generative discovery realm
   2. Procured dscout, which was better suited to these learning needs
3. **Durable process + scalable impact**
   1. Laid the groundwork for ongoing research roadmapping and partnership
   2. Research needs began to be framed from a customer journey perspective, breaking down silos between squads.
   3. Studies were subsequently run to support multiple journey teams at one time.
4. **Effectiveness of Lean hypothesis**
   1. UX Research drove the end-to-end process of the Lean UX hypothesis for the Inventory team
   2. UX Researcher involved PM and designers in study planning, analysis, and synthesis
5. **Cohesive team learning**
   1. Designers translated insights into specific recommendations that directly translated to design decisions.
   2. Our UX Researcher validated that recommendations were grounded in data and heuristics.

> We saw a real difference between the impact of ad hoc studies (based on one Designer’s or PM’s pet theory) and the impact of findings from studies where we aligned on learning objectives and a lean UX hypothesis as a team (and collaborated along the way).
>
> Research as a team sport garnered much more buy-in for recommendations and influence on the product decisions.

## Reflection

### What went well

#### Research execution and overall partnership

1. **Cross-functional involvement in end-to-end research:**&nbsp;Research directly influenced Product and Design decisions that positively impacted Driveway OKRs as reported in product analytics.
2. **Achieved and maintained a good momentum.**
3. **Laid the foundation for continued research planning and prioritization.** Based on the process I established for inputs to research roadmapping, Amy continued to use participatory formats to evaluate partners’ research needs and prioritize research efforts.

I've summarized the first 3 months of the UXR program efforts in a table

| Team / Effort | May 2021 | Jun 2021 | Jul&nbsp; 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| *Tool procurement* | Tool secondary research: define procurement criteria | Tool demos and additional analysis | Business case creation and socialization with mid-level management |

### What didn’t go so well

#### Early collaboration bumps & temporary tool gap

1. There were some collaboration bumps early on between cross-functional teammates
2. There was a ~2-month research tool gap while Lithia finalized the dscout contract—but we had a backup plan involving a pay-as-you-go tool.
3. I was wearing 3 hats and had a lot of work in progress (WIP), which made it challenging to get any one program initiative done quickly.

### What I would improve in the future

1. Expedite tool procurement to avoid or minimize tool gaps.
2. Shadow a few designer-researcher collaboration sessions.
3. Establish programmatic research communications to all of Product and XD as well as to senior leaders.
4. Establish at least one OKR for each research program pillar.
   1. Workshop these with Researcher(s), Director, Design leads, and PMs.
   2. Leverage OKRs to minimize my own work in progress (WIP).
