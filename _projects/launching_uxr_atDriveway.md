## Synopsis

### A brief tour of the program terrain

I launched a comprehensive UX Research program in 6 months, from the first hire to the initial research roadmap.

The program encompassed staffing, tooling, intake and roadmapping for multi-method research, standards for execution, and best practices for cross-functional collaboration.

**UX Research at Driveway supported 4 teams in the first 3 months and later informed design decisions for the homepage redesign** (part of the [brand refresh that I also orchestrated](/project/driving-brand-success){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).

#### Value proposition

Driveway, the largest new-car retailer in the U.S., supports the full car ownership lifecycle, all from the convenience of your home.

* Innovation hub within Lithia Motors (NYSE: LAD, currently \#145 on the Fortune 500)
* Competes with Carvana, CarMax, and Cars.com​​​​​
* $28.2B in revenue in 2022

#### Players

Supporting a distributed US-based team with 8 squads, **my role was Product Design Manager + Design Program Manager**, reporting to the Director of XD.

* ~30-member Experience Design (XD) team, including product designers, content designers, 1 design system designer, 1 UX researcher, and 3 product design managers (including me)
* Built partnerships with Product Managers, Head of Marketing, and Lead Brand Designer

#### Key results

* Staffed first UX Researcher and procured a new research tool
* Achieved initial research velocity of 7 studies per quarter
* Studies directly influenced Product and Design decisions that positively impacted Driveway OKRs
* Laid the foundation for research as a team sport, including cross-functional research planning and prioritization

## The Journey

### Joining Driveway

I joined Driveway in January 2021, just a few months after its initial launch.

* Led Product Design for account center, homepage, internal tools, inventory (sell)
* Acted as design program manager (DPM), launching programs for both UX Research and the Design System, and orchestrating Driveway's "2.woah" brand refresh

## A clear need for research

With an ambitious product roadmap and quarterly major releases, Driveway quickly made a splash in the automotive eCommerce space.

Both product designers and product managers had a strong appetite for conducting user research internally.

It was obvious that Driveway needed to press the gas on research.

I collaborated with my manager, the Director of Experience Design, to define the need:

> Our features sometimes don't perform as we expect, and **we don't understand why.**
>
> This **poses a risk to our investment** in what we bring to market.
>
> Currently, we gather data and insights about Driveway customers' goals and expectations via **ad hoc research studies**, with immediate needs addressed on a first-come, first-served basis.

### Speedbumps on the racetrack

Launching a research program at Driveway posed several challenges:

* No UX Researcher
* High on assumptions, low on UX maturity
* Shoehorned research tool
* Rapid delivery cycle & emerging processes
* Skepticism from the XD Director (my boss)

### My objective

Formally launch UX Research as a product development function. Steer Product and Design decisions through learning, data, and insights.

## Approach: Program Pillars

![](/images/projects/driveway_approach_01@2x.png)

My approach to launching a UX Research program encompassed 4 program pillars:

1. Staff UX Research
2. Identify Design and Product’s learning needs
3. Procure the right research tool for meeting those needs
4. Create a cross-cutting research roadmap

### Implementing the program

Over the course of 6 months, I implemented the research program by&nbsp;

1. Hiring the first dedicated UX Researcher&nbsp;
2. Guiding and iterating on research partnership and process
3. Fostering collaborative research execution (made **How** as important as **Why**)
4. Assessing what kind of learning outcomes designers and PMs cared about
5. Enabling desired learning outcomes by procuring dscout
6. Piloting quarterly research intake through participatory workshops
7. Making the research backlog visible to partners
8. Making learning actionable and relevant to product and design decisions

## Program impact

Overall, my UX Research program set the course for research maturity Driveway.

1. **Successful program liftoff**
   1. Supported 4 journey teams across the funnel in the first 2 months
   2. Achieved initial research velocity of 7 studies per quarter (see table below)
2. **Tool enablement**
   1. Identified that Driveway teams’ learning needs were in the generative discovery realm
   2. Procured dscout, which was better suited to these learning needs
3. **Durable process + scalable impact**
   1. Laid the groundwork for ongoing research roadmapping and partnership
   2. Research needs began to be framed from a customer journey perspective, breaking down silos between squads.
   3. Studies were subsequently run to support multiple journey teams at one time.
4. **Effectiveness of Lean hypothesis**
   1. UX Research drove the end-to-end process of the Lean UX hypothesis for the Inventory team
   2. UX Researcher involved PM and designers in study planning, analysis, and synthesis
5. **Cohesive team learning**
   1. Designers translated insights into specific recommendations that directly translated to design decisions.
   2. Our UX Researcher validated that recommendations were grounded in data and heuristics.

> We saw a **real difference between the impact of ad hoc studies** (based on one Designer’s or PM’s pet theory) **and the impact of findings from studies where we aligned** on learning objectives and a lean UX hypothesis as a team (and collaborated along the way).
>
> Research as a team sport garnered much more buy-in for recommendations and influence on the product decisions.
>
> – Amy C., former Lead UX Researcher at Driveway

I've summarized the first 3 months of the UXR program efforts in the below table:

| Team / Effort | May 2021 | Jun 2021 | Jul&nbsp; 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Inventory* | Sell Landing Page and Offer Screen Redesign Study – Discovery |  | Sell Account Creation and Onboarding – Discovery |
| *MegaCart* | Cart Wrapper |  |  |
| *My Driveway* | Preference Center Study |  | Save Search – Usability |
| *Learn* |  | Top Navigation – Information Architecture Validation | Car Finder Quiz – Copy Validation |
| *Tool procurement* | Tool secondary research: define procurement criteria | Tool demos and additional analysis | Business case creation and socialization with mid-level management |

## Reflection

### What went well

#### Research execution and overall partnership

1. **Cross-functional involvement in end-to-end research:**&nbsp;Research directly influenced Product and Design decisions that positively impacted Driveway OKRs as reported in product analytics.
2. **Achieved and maintained a good momentum.**
3. **Laid the foundation for continued research planning and prioritization.** Based on the process I established for inputs to research roadmapping, Amy continued to use participatory formats to evaluate partners’ research needs and prioritize research efforts.

### What didn’t go so well

#### Early collaboration bumps & temporary tool gap

1. There were some collaboration bumps early on between cross-functional teammates.
2. There was a ~2-month research tool gap while Lithia finalized the dscout contract—but we had a backup plan involving a pay-as-you-go tool.
3. I was wearing 3 hats and had a lot of work in progress (WIP), which made it challenging to get any one program initiative done quickly.

### What I would improve in the future

1. Expedite tool procurement to avoid or minimize tool gaps.
2. Shadow a few designer-researcher collaboration sessions.
3. Establish programmatic research communications to all of Product and XD as well as to senior leaders.
4. Establish at least one OKR for each research program pillar.
   1. Workshop these with Researcher(s), Director, Design leads, and PMs.
   2. Leverage OKRs to minimize my own work in progress (WIP).
