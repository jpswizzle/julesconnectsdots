# Driving growth at the speed of brand recognition

## The speedway to growth

In mid 2021, the Driveway Product team observed an uptick in unique page views and expected this trend to grow significantly over the coming months.

Since Driveway was still new to the automotive eCommerce space, many of these customers would land on the Driveway homepage with limited knowledge of the brand and value proposition.

## Experience objective

As Product and Design, we determined it’s important that we enable these new users to quickly:

* Understand the value of our offering and intuitively flow into the appropriate funnel (buy or sell)
* Get answers to any questions they may have about the brand or their experience through self-service

In order to keep people engaged on Driveway.com, we wanted our brand and homepage to feel exciting and captivating, with a *wow factor* that distinguished us from competitors.

## Paving the way by evolving the design system

As Driveway matured its brand presence, the design system had to be in lockstep. I orchestrated both the evolution of the Driveway design system and the cross-functional execution of an organization-wide brand refresh.

## Launching the new brand

We launched Brand 2.woah's redesigned homepage as the first touchpoint with the new brand and design system assets. I oversaw the research and redesign process, which my team of researchers and designers executed. We affectionately referred to the brand as 2.woah.

This effort led to a significant increase in monthly unique visitors and enhanced the overall user experience.
