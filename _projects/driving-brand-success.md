  As Driveway prepared to mature its brand presence, the design system had to
  pave the way. I orchestrated both the evolution of the Driveway design system
  and the cross-functional execution of an organization-wide brand refresh.

## The speedway to growth

In mid 2021, the Driveway Product team observed an uptick in unique page views and expected this trend to grow significantly over the coming months.

Since Driveway was still new to the automotive eCommerce space, many of these customers would land on the Driveway homepage with limited knowledge of the brand and value proposition.

## Experience objective

### **Driving growth at the speed of brand recognition**

As Product and Design, we determined it’s important that we enable these new users to quickly:

* Understand the value of our offering and intuitively flow into the appropriate funnel (buy or sell)
* Get answers to any questions they may have about the brand or their experience through self-service

In order to keep people engaged on Driveway.com, we wanted our brand and homepage to feel exciting and captivating, with a *wow factor* that distinguished us from competitors.

## Paving the way by evolving the design system

As Driveway's senior product designers and lead brand designer collaborated closely to hone the brand vision and visual language necessary to mature Driveway's brand presence, I prepared to drive alignment across the XD team.

### Switching on the fog lights

Rebranding efforts can often feel like driving up a winding mountain road in the night fog—especially when executed internally.

Evolving the Driveway design system through a weekly design system guild shone the fog lights on the meandering course.

Outside of the XD team, I also provided regular updates in the biweekly sync between lead product designers and the UI engineers who owned their squad's contributions to the design system code base.

### Turning on the power steering

The scope of my responsibility in guiding brand refresh quickly expanded from coordinating the XD team and design system efforts to orchestrating cross-functional release planning.

Product Managers and Delivery Leads began to have questions, and I was the leader who possessed both a breadth and depth of knowledge on the initiative.

To increase shared understanding and decrease anxiety around the unknowns, I created visual artifacts to socialize the effort:

* **Pitstops:**&nbsp;a one-page explainer of the brand refresh phases
* **Release goal posts:** an accompanying one-page "menu" of the recommended approach to implementing Driveway's new color palette in forthcoming product releases

## Launching the new brand

We launched Brand 2.woah's redesigned homepage as the first touchpoint with the new brand and design system assets. I oversaw the research and redesign process, which my team of researchers and designers executed. We affectionately referred to the brand as 2.woah.

This effort led to a significant increase in monthly unique visitors and enhanced the overall user experience.
