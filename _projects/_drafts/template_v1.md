## Synopsis

### North star

*Increase Driveway brand recognition and credibility by refreshing the Driveway brand, maturing our Design System, and launching a new home page*

### Program overview

I orchestrated a comprehensive brand refresh in the span of 6 months, resulting in the simultaneous launch of a new home page, new CSS, and rebranded multi-channel marketing campaign.

As the lead on this multi-prong effort, I oversaw and guided the evolution of the design system, planned the first 2 releases in partnership with our front-end architect, and coordinated cross-functional execution.

#### Value proposition

Driveway, the largest new-car retailer in the U.S., launched in September 2020 as Lithia Motors' move to

* support the end-to-end car ownership lifecycle, all from the convenience of your home
* gain competitive advantage over automotive eCommerce big-hitters CarMax, Cars.com, and Carvana

#### Team players

Supporting a distributed US-based team with 8 squads, **my role was Product Design Manager + Design Program Manager**, reporting to the Director of XD.

I staffed the first dedicated Design System Designer, Melinda L., without whom this large undertaking would not have been possible.

In addition, I closely collaborated with a broad cross-functional team:
* Lead Front-end Architect
* 8 Lead + Senior Product Designers
* Senior Brand Designer
* Delivery Leads
* 8 squads
* 6 Product Managers

#### Key results

* Driveway's new brand launched on December 1, 2021
  * Driveway.com, already sporting the new type system, launched with a limited new color palette
  * The new home page and marketing collateral launched with the full new color palette and new type system
* Driveway.com reached 1MM MUVs within 3 months of the brand launch
