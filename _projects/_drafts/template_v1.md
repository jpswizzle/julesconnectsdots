## Synopsis

### North star

*Increase Driveway brand recognition and credibility by refreshing the Driveway brand, maturing our Design System, and launching a new home page*

### Initiative overview

I drove a 'build' decision for a 0-to-1 insurance proposal-building tool by owning and executing a CEO-sponsored 2-week design sprint—while hiring 5 new UX team members in Denver and Atlanta.

After quickly onboarding the team and performing knowledge transfer, I then joined the Lead Product Manager and a VP of Engineering in research-based requirements gathering.

I informed product scope and complex requirements for the new product via rapid prototyping, concept testing, and contextual inquiry.

This product was our first foray into creating a new design system, which we soon expanded to design two more products in the platform.

#### Value proposition

Vertafore, an insurtech industry leader, streamlines every point of the insurance distribution channel for 21,000 agencies and 1300 carriers in North America.

This new product was part of a $45MM board-level investment in a greenfield platform.

The new product would
* open up sales whitespace and increase annual recurring revenue (ARR)
* decrease the time insurance agents spent on creating lengthy insurance proposals for new and renewing clients
* reduce the likelihood of Errors & Omissions, which presented ongoing financial risk to insurance agencies

#### Team players

As the Head of User Experience, I staffed and led a multi-disciplinary core UX team of 5 at the Denver headquarters, later growing to 7. Supporting 2 other business units and their flagship product, I staffed a Lead UX Designer in Atlanta and managed a Lead UX Designer in East Lansing, Michigan.

My core team in Denver comprised:
* UX Designer and Lead UX Designer
* UI Designer and Lead UI Designer
* Lead UX Strategist
* Lead UI Developer
* Content Designer / UX Writer

I partnered with:
* Director of Product and 5 Senior PMs
* 2 Product Owners
* Engineering leadership (2 VPs and a Senior Director)
* Engineering Managers and Leads
* 9 squads

#### Key results

* Driveway's new brand launched on December 1, 2021
  * Driveway.com, already sporting the new type system, launched with a limited new color palette
  * The new home page and marketing collateral launched with the full new color palette and new type system
* Driveway.com reached 1MM MUVs within 3 months of the brand launch

## The Journey

### The Challenge
![Initial Sketches][]

Vertafore's Proposal Builder project kicked off as a 2-week, CEO-sponsored proof-of-concept sprint—while I was in the midst of hiring. There was no apparent scope or clear requirements at the outset. My charge was to prototype a "sexier" proposal tool with "better UX" than a startup competitor. This tool would have two primary personas: an insurance agency admin and an account manager. Above are my initial sketches for the account manager flow.

### User Research and Ideation
![Medium-Fidelity Prototype][]

Consulting with business analysts on Vertafore's existing agency management solutions, I quickly acquainted myself with an account manager's high-level workflow for creating a proposal. Using the Sircon business unit's Sketch library as a springboard, I created a medium-fidelity prototype with the intent of introducing a new UX paradigm.

### Customer-Centric UI Design
![Customer Snapshot][]

While the legacy agency solutions were fraught with nested tab navigation and endless tables, most key tasks began with the customer's account. I made this customer-centric paradigm the focal point of the UI using a card pattern. Research participants consistently loved the Customer Snapshot, which later became a key pattern of Alloy Design System (see case study).

### Streamlining Proposal Workflows
![Create Submission][]

In the Create Submission step of the workflow (which was later scoped to another agency platform module), I created a collapsed state for the Customer Snapshot with fewer details. This allowed for visual emphasis on the quote comparison table, which I styled as a column.

### Insights from field research
![Create Submission][]

Following a successful demo to the executive team, the product development team set out to conduct field research. A majority of the account managers we met worked at L-shaped desks with three monitors. They were all highly relationship-driven, service-minded, and task-oriented. Many had been in the industry for decades and were not tech-savvy.

### Service-driven workflow
![Create Submission][]

We repeatedly observed the inordinate amount of data (re)entry and paperwork required to sell and manage insurance. Service teams revolved around checklists, forms, spreadsheets, and binders. Each agency customized their system for their specific market, but a service-driven workflow that increased time to market and improved brand presence while reducing the risk of error was the common theme.

### Collaborating on concept models
![Create Submission][]

Back in Denver, my Lead UX Strategist and I shared findings with our internal stakeholders and my newly onboarded team. My team and I began to sketch concept models and explore approaches to streamlining proposal workflows. Account Managers needed to import data from their legacy agency tool into an admin-created proposal template, and then create customer-specific content for each proposal.

### Navigation and content creation
![WYSIWYG Editor][]

One of the interaction models we partnered closely with engineering on was the way an account manager might navigate a multi-page document while creating and editing content for each section in a WYSIWYG text editor. I sketched out 3 options: by page, by section, or a hybrid of the two. The final design allowed for navigation by section and subsection.

### Table of contents and customizable content 
![Edit Table of Contents][]

Further user research also highlighted the need for account managers to populate each Table of Contents from an admin-created section "library". The product manager added this feature to the product backlog, and the UI team later repurposed the library pattern for a few other types of reusable content. Shown above is the "Edit Table of Contents" screen in production.

### Design challenge: handling imported data
![Create Submission][]

One major design challenge was creating a simplified way for account managers to import "schedules" from their legacy systems. These tables of insured items may contain a dozen vehicles or two thousand vehicles. The UI needed to support both without overwhelming the user. I suggested showing account managers a summary of each imported table upon successful import.

### User acceptance testing
![Create Submission][]

During early user acceptance testing, we learned that account managers needed the ability to add, remove, and reorder table columns and rows. My UX Designer worked closely with the Product Owner to define the requirements. Shown above is the UI that the engineering team implemented following wireframing, usability testing, and UI Design.
