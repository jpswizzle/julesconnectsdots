      <h3 class="title">Hey, I’m Jules—nice to meet you!</h3>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">I’m a designer, researcher, facilitator, and educator. I have over 16 years of experience in UX and a knack for crystallizing solutions in complex problem spaces.
      </p>
      <p>My hands-on skills encompass the end-to-end product design process from defining the problem and conducting user discovery to iterating on design concepts and creating interactive prototypes. I am technically fluent and appreciate architecture patterns.
      </p>
      <p>As a UX leader, I drive vision and execution to achieve strategic outcomes through actionable insights, coaching, and partnership. As a people manager, I grow my team by cultivating self-awareness, continual feedback, and individual growth milestones. I enjoy igniting each individual's <em>unique spark</em>.
      </p>
      <p>I thrive on collaborating with empowered product teams. As an agile champion, I seamlessly integrate Design and Research with product development, using Lean UX and design sprints to foster team cohesion and deliver measurable outcomes.
