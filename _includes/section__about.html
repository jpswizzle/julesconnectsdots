      <h3 class="title">Hey, I’m Jules—nice to meet you!</h3>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">I’m a designer, researcher, facilitator, and educator. With over 16 years of experience in UX, I have a knack for crystallizing solutions in complex problem spaces.
      </p>
      
      <p>As a leader, I drive vision and execution to achieve strategic outcomes through actionable insights, coaching, and partnership. As a people manager, I enjoy igniting each individual's <em>problem-solving spark</em>. I grow designers and researchers by cultivating self-awareness, continual feedback, and individual-led growth milestones.
      </p>
      <p>My hands-on skills encompass the end-to-end product design process from defining the problem, to conducting user discovery, creating and iterating on design concepts, and creating interactive prototypes.
      </p>
      <p>I am energized by collaborating with empowered PDE teams. As a partner, I adapt lean-agile methods to integrate Design and Research into the PDLC. Working in software over the past 9 years, I have found Lean UX and design sprints to reliably create team cohesion within high-performing teams, amplifying their impact and delivering measurable outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>I’m currently looking to join forces with empowered teams solving gnarly problems. Don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
