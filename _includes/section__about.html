      <p>As a design and research leader, I drive vision and execution to achieve strategic outcomes through actionable insights, coaching, and partnership. With over 5 years of experience managing multidisciplinary UX teams, I enjoying igniting each individual's <em>problem-solving spark</em>. I help designers and researchers grow by cultivating self-awareness, continual feedback, and individual-led growth milestones.

      <p>My hands-on skills encompass the end-to-end product design process from defining the problem and hypothesis, to conducting user discovery, creating and iterating on design concepts, and creating interactive prototypes at whatever level of fidelity makes sense.

      <p>I am energized by collaborating with empowered teams. As a partner to Product and Engineering, I adapt lean-agile methods to integrate Design and Research as a sturdy leg of the 3-legged stool. Over the past 9 years, I have found Lean UX and design sprints to reliably create team cohesion within high-performing teams, amplifying their impact and delivering measurable outcomes.
